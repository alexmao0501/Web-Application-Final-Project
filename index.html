            <p>
                My name is Alex Mao, I'm a master's student in Boston University Computer Science program currently.
                I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate majors in quantitative finance and economics. After graduation, I took a position as a portfolio analyst at <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com">JP Morgan</a>.
                After working in JP Morgan for more than two years, I was adept at uncovering markets insights and leveraging my communication skills to explain portfolio strategy to portfolio managers and institutional government investors.
                As for my career, I can envision a bright future at JP Morgan, but to be honest, I am not satisfied with observing and analyzing various financial instruments. After a great deal of soul-searching and career due diligence, I realized that a role making business strategy and decisions would be more engaging for me
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I am excited about the emergence of big data, since data analytics insights can be game changers that uncover otherwise unknown market opportunities or trends.
                It would be quite natural for me to combine my quant skills and business acumen in a data analyst role, especially in the technology industry, where there is massive data available, and products are launched rapidly on a global scale.
                My long-term goal is to build a data analytics system that provides tools and insights to level the playing field for startups to compete in international markets and bring lasting value with great impact to the industry.
            </p>
