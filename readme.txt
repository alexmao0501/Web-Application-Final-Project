Ideas for content/function for site:

Biography page is the main page and is also my personal introduction. 
Aboutme page has the same form as the first page, but the content is more specific on the contact information and some brief summary of my hobbies to show some personal image as well.
Hobby page includes more details in it. I present some sample pictures and videos at this page and create two more pages to connect with more details that are the travel page and movies page respectively.
Contact me page is like a feedback form and can send any information to my email after fill the form.
Resume page is using json function to show my education background, skills and working experience to know me more about it. And this resume is different from the about me page.
Countdown page is a surprise to all who visit my page since only less than 20 days to 2023 so for me it's a great ending to finish this final project and thank you for helping me on this lecture!
